# Problem Statement
In this data analysis project we are trying to analyse how likely a customer is to switch from one telecom provider to another. In telecom technology terms, churning is referred to the event of a customer switching to another telecom provider.

# Proposed Solution
In order to perform the aforementioned analysis we are making use of Logistic Regression.
Logistic Regression is a Machine Learning classification algorithm that is used to predict the probability of a categorical dependent variable. In logistic regression, the dependent variable is a binary variable that contains data coded as 1(success, yes, true, etc. ) or 0(failure, no, false, etc. )
